<h2 id="title">Learning Tapestry Privacy Policy</h2>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Because we provide services to many partners, there are potentially
    many different ways you can use our service. Sometimes these partners may represent our
    services to you as their own. Regardless of how your data comes into our system, we
    will treat it carefully, preserving your privacy according to the rules laid out in
    this document, and to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we&rsquo;re
    using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy and use our
    services. Our Privacy Policy explains: What information we collect and why we collect
    it, and how we use that information.</p>

<p>Whether you are an individual user or an organization with many
    users, the privacy of your data is very important to Learning
    Tapestry. Whether you are new to Learning Tapestry or a long time user,
    please do take the time to get to know our practices &ndash; and if you have any
    questions consult this page or contact us directly.</p>

<h5>FERPA and
    other regulatory obligations</h5>

<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2008-4/120908a.pdf">
    FERPA</a> <img src="http://www.adobe.com/images/pdficon_small.png"/>&nbsp;and other educational and data privacy
regulations as they
apply to your data. For more technical information on how we
abide by FERPA please see this <a href="http://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/cloud-computing.pdf">
    link</a> <img src="http://www.adobe.com/images/pdficon_small.png"/>.</p>

<h4>What
    information we collect and why we collect it.</h4>

<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our
    users. We collect information in two ways:</p>

<h5>Information you
    give us</h5>

<p>For example, some of our services may require you to sign up for a
    Learning Tapestry Account. When you do, we&rsquo;ll ask for personal information, like
    your name, email address, and a password.</p>

<p></p>

<h5>Information we
    get from your use of our services</h5>

<p>We may collect information about the learning services that you use
    and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our services or you view
    and interact with our technology via a browser plug-in. This information
    includes:</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Credential
    information</h3>

<p>We may obtain and compare your provided login credentials with
    known credentials associated with your account in order to provide you access with your
    account. We may store and issue temporary credentials on your behalf for purposes such
    as password resets.</p>

<h3>Device
    information</h3>

<p>We may collect device&shy; specific information (such as your
    hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network
    information including phone number). Learning Tapestry may associate your device
    identifiers or phone number with your Learning Tapestry Account.</p>

<h3>Log and
    application information</h3>

<p>When you use our services or view content provided by Learning
    Tapestry, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs.
    This may include: details of how you used our service, such as your activities on
    authorized learning websites, Internet protocol address, device event information such
    as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the
    date and time of your request and referral URL, cookies that may uniquely identify your
    browser or your Learning Tapestry Account.</p>

<h3>Network
    information</h3>

<p>When you use a Learning Tapestry service, we may collect and
    process information about your network, such as your IP address, your Internet Service
    Provider, your domain name, your bandwidth, your network route to the Internet and to
    our services.</p>

<h3>Location
    information</h3>

<p>When you use a location &shy;enabled Learning Tapestry service, we
    may collect and process information about your actual location. When you do not use a
    location enabled service, we may infer your approximate location by examining your
    Network information.</p>

<h3>Local
    storage</h3>

<p>We may collect and store information (including personal
    information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage
    (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</p>

<h3>Cookies and
    anonymous identifiers</h3>

<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information when
    you visit a Learning Tapestry service or a partner who uses our technology, and this
    may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We
    also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to
    our partners, such as Learning Tapestry features that may appear on other
    sites.</p>

<h5>How we use
    information we collect.</h5>

<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services first
    and foremost to provide information to our customers and partners to help them provide
    services based on the information. We also use the information to provide, maintain,
    protect and improve the services we offer as well as to develop new services, to keep
    our system running effectively and to protect Learning Tapestry and our
    users.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We will never sell information provided by, or about,
    our customers or partners to anyone.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We may share information about our customers or partners with
    partners for purposes of delivering our services. For example, we might share
    information about specific users to a data analytics partner who can analyze this
    information to provide predictions about the services a user might need (this is
    sometimes called "predictive analytics" or "collaborative filtering"). In cases where
    we do share information in this way to partners, we will ensure that the partner is
    bound by the same or similar privacy agreement as this one, so that your information
    cannot be used by that organization in a way that is different from how we use it, as
    described in this privacy policy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We may use the name you provide for your Learning Tapestry Profile
    across all of the services we offer that require a Learning Tapestry Account. In
    addition, we may replace past names associated with your Learning Tapestry Account so
    that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already
    have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your
    publicly visible Learning Tapestry Profile information, such as your name and photo.
    When you contact Learning Tapestry, we may keep a record of your communication to help
    solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about
    our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements, or in
    the case of urgent updates.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies,
    like pixel tags and web page events, to improve your user experience and the overall
    quality of our services. For example, we may track a website you visit and some
    information about what you do on that website, with your permission or the permission
    of your school or learning system partner. We may combine personal information from one
    service with information, including personal information, from other Learning Tapestry
    services &ndash; for example to improve our ability to provide relevant services to
    you.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose
    other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. Learning Tapestry processes
    personal information on servers located in the United States. As a result, we may
    process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you
    live.</p>

<p></p>

<h5>Transparency and
    choice</h5>

<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear
    about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it
    is used. In some cases your information may be managed by a third party such as school
    or learning company. In those cases, your control over the use of your data at Learning
    Tapestry may be the responsibility of that third party. We will always do our best to
    help you work with that third party to manage your information. In all cases where it
    applies, we will follow FERPA and other privacy and data use regulations.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We always aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects
    information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete
    information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our
    active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems, but we will
    still follow this Privacy Policy when managing those residual copies.</p>

<h5>Information we
    share</h5>

<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations
    and individuals outside of Learning Tapestry unless one of the following circumstances
    applies:</p>

<h3>With your
    consent</h3>

<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
    individuals outside of Learning Tapestry when we have your consent to do so. We require
    opt-&shy;in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>

<h3>With partner
    administrators</h3>

<p>If your Learning Tapestry Account is managed for you by a Learning
    Tapestry partner then your administrator and others who provide user support to your
    organization may have access to your Learning Tapestry Account information (including
    your email and other activity data). Your administrator may be able to: view statistics
    regarding your account, like statistics regarding web and other applications you
    interact with. Please refer to your administrator&rsquo;s privacy policy for more
    information.</p>

<h3>With partner
    administrator authorized recipients</h3>

<p>In some cases, partner administrators will authorize other parties
    to view or interact with your information, usually to improve the services you receive
    related to the information. For example, a partner administrator may make your data
    available to your teacher, so they can help you learn.</p>

<h3>For external
    processing</h3>

<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted
    businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance
    with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate regulations, confidentiality and
    security measures.</p>

<h3>For legal
    reasons</h3>

<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
    individuals outside of Learning Tapestry if we have a good faith belief that access,
    use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: meet any
    applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, enforce
    applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations, detect,
    prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, protect against harm
    to the rights, property or safety of Learning Tapestry, our users or the public as
    required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>We may share aggregated, non&shy;-personally identifiable
    information with our partners for purposes of improving our services. For example, we
    may share information publicly or with investors to show trends about the general use
    of our services. If Learning Tapestry is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset
    sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and
    give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes
    subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<h5>Information
    security</h5>

<p>We work hard to protect Learning Tapestry and our users from
    unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of
    information we hold. In particular: We encrypt many
    of&nbsp;our services using SSL. We review our information collection,
    storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard
    against unauthorized access to systems. We restrict access to
    personal information to Learning Tapestry employees, contractors and agents who need to
    know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict
    contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they
    fail to meet these obligations.</p>

<h4>When this
    Privacy Policy applies</h4>

<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by
    Learning Tapestry and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such
    as our partners) where the data from those services is managed by Learning Tapestry,
    but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this
    Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other
    companies or individuals, including products or sites that may include Learning
    Tapestry services, or other sites linked to from our services. Our Privacy Policy does
    not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise
    our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and
    offer relevant services.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Compliance and
    cooperation with regulatory authorities</h4>

<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also
    adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written
    complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work
    with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection
    authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we
    cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Changes Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will
    not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will
    post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we
    will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email
    notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this
    Privacy Policy in an archive for your review upon request. If
    you have questions regarding our privacy policy you can email
    privacy atsymbol learningtapestry.com&nbsp;for more information.</p>
