# Ansible Notes

## Installation

Easiest method if Python and Pip are installed:

```
sudo pip install ansible --update
```
Otherwise:

Easy install for Mac and Linux machines, follow: http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html

From docs:  "Currently Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2.6 installed (Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine). This includes Red Hat, Debian, CentOS, OS X, any of the BSDs, and so on."

## Usage

**Important**:  Ansible runs by ssh keys by default.  The target machine must have the public key of the Ansible user in .ssh/authorized_keys for Ansible to function.

### Setup

1. Create /etc/ansible if not already created
2. Create an *inventory* file of /etc/ansible/hosts with IP or hostname of machines

### Commands

- ```ansible -i [inventory/host file]``` - run with host parameter instead of /etc/ansible

Below: [target] can be: all, IP address, hostname or group defined in inventory

- ```ansible [target] -m ping``` - Ping all machines in Ansible inventory (host file)
- ```ansible [target] -a "/bin/unixcommand param"``` - Run a command on a target machine
- ```ansible webservers -m apt -a "name=acme state=installed"``` - Check package version (NOTE: this actually installed the package, different from docs)
- ```ansible [target] -m apt -a "name=nginx state=removed"``` - Ensure a package is not installed  (NOTE: this actually removed the package, different from docs)
- ```ansible [target] -m git -a "repo=git://foo.example.org/repo.git dest=/srv/myapp version=HEAD"``` - Deploying from source control
- ```ansible [target] -m setup``` - Discovering facts from machine, hardware, network config, Linux distro, etc.
