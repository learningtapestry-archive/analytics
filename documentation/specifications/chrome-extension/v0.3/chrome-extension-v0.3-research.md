**Login:**:  Well guided sign-up user experience, made fast/easy w/ G+.  I thought I had a Pocket account, didn't, very easy to create new account.  Easier with G+.

Whoops, misstep in ideal UX flow - they didn't detect extension was already installed, but interesting here:  their privacy notice and link to policy.
